 Club/Social Service:<br>

We also believe that for us to give to the community we must also be able to enjoy ourselves. Part of what the club aims to achieve is to ensure that lifelong friendships are established. Various social events are held throughout the year to promote a social environment for our members as well as
inter-club events to ensure that strong ties are made between Rotaract clubs.</li>
